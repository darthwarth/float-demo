        <h1>Float Demo</h1>
        <h3>The example boxes have been given a border to more easily see the outline of the containing div. The containing div houses an image and text.</h3>
        <h4>Box one has a blue border</h4>
        <h4>Box two has a red border</h4>
        <h4>Box three has a green border</h4>
        <h4>Box four has a black border</h4>
        <div class="container-one container">
            <img src="blue_orange.jpeg" class="first-image image">
            <div class="text">
                This box has the image floated left. Floated elements don't force the containing element 
                to resize to accommodate them. For example, if the only thing in this element was the floated 
                element, then the containing element would reduce in height to nothing, hence why the border of the 
                containing element is currently only containing the text.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container-two container">
            <img src="blue_orange.jpeg" class="second-image image">
            <div class="text">
                In this box the image is floated to the right, but because the float is still active from box one, the 
                image in box one has overflowed over it.
                <br /><br />
                In order to fix this any preceding floats need to be cleared.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container-three container">
            <img src="blue_orange.jpeg" class="third-image image">
            <div class="text">
                Here the image is floated to the left, and the preceding floats have been cleared so the above elements 
                don't spill over into this one. However, the image still spills out of the bottom of the containing element. 
                This can be fixed by setting the display property.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container-four container">
            <img src="blue_orange.jpeg" class="fourth-image image">
            <div class="text">
                This box has the image floated right. It also has all the previous floats (left and right) cleared, so the 
                floats set above don't overflow into it, and it has its display property set so that none of the floated elements 
                in the containing element spill out beyond its borders.
                <br /><br />
                <i>display: flow-root;</i> is favoured over the more previously commonly used <i>overflow: auto;</i> due to some cases where 
                certain side-effects were caused by overflow.
